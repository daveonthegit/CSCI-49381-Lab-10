    <h2 id="introduction-to-sql">Introduction to SQL</h2>
    <p>SQL -- or the Structured Query Language -- "is a computer
      language designed for the retrieval and management of data in
      relational database management systems, database schema creation
      and modification, and database object access control management"[<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">2</a>]. Put simply, it's
      a database query language. SQL (pronounced "sequel" or S-Q-L) has
      been around since the 1970s, and was standardized by ANSI in 1986.
      SQL is ubiquitous -- practically all current relational databases
      in use today speak some vendor-specific variant of SQL, and most
      enterprise web applications use a relational database on the back
      end. Furthermore, scripting languages like Python, Perl, Ruby, and
      PHP that are often used for web development and all have robust,
      easy to use SQL modules. In fact, the combination of <strong>L</strong>inux





      servers, the <strong>A</strong>pache http daemon, the <strong>M</strong>ySQL





      relational database, and the <strong>P</strong>HP scripting
      language are so popular for web development today that it has its
      own acronym -- <strong>LAMP</strong>.</p>
    <p>Dedicated database servers are valuable because they free
      programmers from the task of creating customized data storage
      systems from scratch (which are likely to have bugs and
      shortcomings). SQL serves as a common language for many database
      systems, allowing programmers to ignore most details of the
      specific database system in use (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL,
      etc.). Overall, this modularity improves performance and makes
      maintenance and portability easier.</p>
    <p>Additionally, general-purpose database systems like MySQL are a
      win because the performance critical code is written in a fast
      language like C or C++, while applications using the database can
      be created with a slower, user-friendly scripting language. This
      is especially important when databases contain millions of entries
      because a database written in a relatively slow scripting language
      would be prohibitively expensive from a computational and time
      perspective. SQL servers can run on the same machine that serves
      the application, or they can be accessed via the network, allowing
      a web frontend and database backend to operate on separate
      machines. This flexibility can enable more efficient use of
      computing resources and can add other other benefits, such as
      easier backups.</p>
    <h2 id="sql-examples">SQL Examples</h2>
    <p>For example, an online retailer might have a database table for
      all their <strong>inventory</strong> with the columns <strong>product





        number, name, price</strong>, and number in <strong>stock</strong>.
      The programmer can craft a database query requesting all products
      whose <strong>name</strong>s' second letter is an "x" like so:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE name LIKE '_x%';</code></pre>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="other/idea.png"> In SQL, an underscore ( _ ) matches
        any single character, while a percent ( % ) matches any sequence
        of characters (like * in DOS and UNIX)</p>
    </div>
    <p>We could also perform a query filtering out the 10 items with the
      cheapest <strong>price</strong>:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM inventory ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 10;</code></pre>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="other/idea.png"> In SQL, "ORDER BY foo ASC" sorts by
        the values in the column 'foo', ascending (least to greatest).
        Using DESC sorts from greatest to least. "LIMIT N" limits the
        result to N items (after the ordering clause).</p>
    </div>
    <p>We could also ask for just the names of items whose price is
      greater than 100:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT name FROM inventory WHERE price &gt; 100;</code></pre>
    <p>SQL results are typically returned to the programming language as
      a list (array) or similar data structure. The programmer can then
      work with the list in her favorite language, make further queries,
      or display the data in some way. In executing queries like this,
      the SQL database -- not the application -- performs the selection,
      filtering, and alphabetization. Not having to write new code to do
      this (and more) saves application developers a tremendous amount
      of time.</p>
    <h2 id="sql-injection">SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>Because small flaws can often be leveraged into much larger
      exploits, simple programming mistakes and omissions often result
      in unexpected negative security effects. For example, PHP is every
      bit as vulnerable to failures of <strong>input validation</strong>
      such as filesystem and directory traversal exploits as are Perl
      and Python because these vulnerabilities are a result of system
      semantics and the necessity of programs to be capable of
      performing general purpose tasks like reading files.</p>
    <p>Poorly written applications that interface with SQL are no
      different. A common class of attacks are called <strong>SQL
        injection attacks</strong> which -- like directory traversal and
      buffer overflow vulnerabilities -- are the result of not properly
      <strong>validating input</strong> and implicitly granting
      applications privilege they do not require. In this case, the
      non-validated input actually contains SQL statements and relies on
      the application to naively insert the user input into the
      application's own request.</p>
    <p>For example, imagine a fatally flawed web interface for the
      Social Security Administration where you enter your Social
      Security number (123006789) and the system displays a summary of
      your account and personal information. Using MySQL and PHP, the
      application might include code like this:</p>
    <pre><code>$ssn = $_POST['ssn'];                                      // get ssn from web form POST data
$query = "SELECT * FROM personal WHERE ssn LIKE '$ssn'";   // construct query (notice embedded $ssn variable)
$result = mysqli_query($query);                             // execute query
echo "$result\n";                                          // output result</code></pre>
    <p>If the value for $ssn contained 123006789, the application would
      construct the following SQL query and execute it:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM personal WHERE ssn LIKE '123006789'</code></pre>
    <p>The result would be your personal data.</p>
    <p>Now imagine that instead of entering <em>your</em> Social
      Security number, you enter <strong>%</strong> -- the <strong>SQL
        wildcard</strong> matching anything. The application foolishly
      takes your input as valid and blithely plugs it in to the SQL
      statement:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM personal WHERE ssn LIKE '%'</code></pre>
    <p>This would return the personal information of everyone in the
      table with a Social Security number!</p>
    <p>Even worse, if the user entered the following input into the SSN
      field</p>
    <p><code>'; DROP TABLE personal</code></p>
    <p>... the constructed query would be:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM personal WHERE ssn LIKE ''; DROP TABLE personal</code></pre>
    <p>The semicolon ( ; ) character separates individual SQL statements
      and "DROP TABLE tablename" is how database tables are deleted.
      Thus -- if not for a restriction in PHP applications -- this could
      result in the deletion the entire <code>personal</code> table
      from the database! (XKCD had a <a
        href="http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/327:_Exploits_of_a_Mom">funny





        comic about this very issue</a>.)</p>
    <h2 id="input-validation-and-sanitization">Input Validation and
      Sanitization</h2>
    <p>As we can see, this is a malicious SQL statement and a
      dangerously negligent application. Using the LIKE operator is a
      subtle example of <strong>unnecessary privilege</strong>. Because
      everyone has a unique Social Security number, there is <strong>no
        chance</strong> that a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob()">glob match</a>
      (enabled by LIKE in SQL) will be required. At the very least, the
      above code should have used the exact match test = (equals sign)
      instead of LIKE, which would have returned an error when it was
      given a wildcard to match. The database also has a permissions
      problem, because the application accessing the database does not
      need to be able to use the DROP TABLE command. (Database users
      have permissions similar to users on a filesystem -- but the
      permissions still need to be configured properly.)</p>
    <p>More fundamentally, this application is fatally flawed due to the
      total lack of <strong>input validation</strong>. Since all Social
      Security numbers are 9 digits, there is <strong>no chance</strong>
      that a legitimate user would ever need to enter anything but 9
      digits into the SSN field. It is trivial to first check the
      contents of a variable before using it -- making sure that it
      contains only numbers or letters, etc. -- this is called <strong>input





        validation</strong>. In this way, punctuation, letters, and
      everything but numbers would cause an error before the SQL
      statement was even assembled.</p>
    <p>However, making sure that the SSN contains just numbers or
      letters only works if you have purely numerical or alphabetical
      data. Unfortunately, it's not always possible to use this
      approach, because many fields require letters, letters and
      numbers, or even arbitrary characters that have special meaning in
      SQL like the single quote ( ' ) and semicolon ( ; ) that we used
      for our DROP TABLES statement. For example, consider a web forum
      where users' posts are stored in a database. Since posts can
      contain virtually any input, the database must be able to safely
      handle arbitrary input. Instead of <strong>validating</strong>
      our input, we want a way to <strong>sanitize</strong> it -- to
      make it safe.</p>
    <h2 id="the-old-way----escaping-input-for-sql">The Old Way --
      Escaping Input for SQL</h2>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><img src="other/alert.png"> <strong>Note:</strong> While
        manual validation and escaping of input is the classic approach
        to this problem, <em>it's no longer considered a best practice</em>.
        It's better to use prepared statements (see the next section).
        It is possible to bypass basic string escaping by using an <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5741187/sql-injection-that-gets-around-mysql-real-escape-string">input





          that can be dangerous and does not require escaping to be
          valid</a>, such as <code>1 OR 1=1</code>, or fiddling with
        character encoding. Prepared statements also give a performance
        boost, because escaping input is fairly inefficient!</p>
      Again, this material is left here for informational purposes only
      (do not use it for this assignment). </div>
    <p>The classic mitigation to this problem used to be validation in
      conjunction with something called "string escaping." Validation
      was performed using functions to test data for various properties,
      such as being integers, floating point numbers, or alphanumeric
      (perhaps with various allowed punctuation). This is one of the
      sources of strange restrictions on what characters can be used in
      passwords for various services.</p>
    <p>If a string contains special characters, we need a way to inform
      a parser (in this case the SQL server) that the characters should
      be treated simply as regular characters, not as characters with
      special meaning in SQL. Traditionally, this is done by putting a
      backslash ( ) in front of the each special character. For example,
      in most languages, to include a double quote character ( " ) in a
      double-quoted string, we can usually use the following syntax:</p>
    <pre><code>escaped = "here is a double quote: \" and now i'll end the string"</code></pre>
    <p>In essence, the backslash says "don't end the string here -- just
      treat it as a regular double quote character".</p>
    <p>Most languages have functions that will sanitize or "escape"
      strings being used in MySQL requests. In PHP, the function is <code>mysqli_real_escape_string(foo)</code>.
      It will take the string <code>foo</code> and return an escaped
      version. For example, if we did the following:</p>
    <pre><code>$ssn_escaped = mysqli_real_escape_string($ssn);</code></pre>
    <p>... <code>$ssn_escaped</code> would contain:</p>
    <pre><code>\'\; DROP TABLE personal</code></pre>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="other/idea.png"> The function <code>mysqli_real_escape_string()</code>
        will only function properly ''after'' a connection to a mysql
        server has been made. If <code>mysqli_real_escape_string()</code>
        seems to be returning empty strings, make sure that its
        invocations follow a connection to a mysql server.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since the special characters are now escaped with the backslash,
      they'll be treated as regular letters -- not special SQL tokens:
      Thus, our original query would become:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM personal WHERE ssn LIKE '\'\; DROP TABLE personal'</code></pre>
    <p>...and of course, there is no ssn like <code>\'\; DROP TABLE
        personal</code>. Running this query wouldn't drop the table, it
      would simply return an error.</p>
    <p>Errors due to lack of input validation and sanitization happen
      constantly, not just with SQL. The <em>only</em> response is to
      write code with the least possible privilege and to perform
      comprehensive and correct validation (or sanitization) on all
      input.</p>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="other/idea.png">For this assignment, you'll use
        Prepared Statements instead of string escaping. Read on!</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="prepared-statements">Prepared Statements</h2>
    <p>Prepared statements are an improved approach for protecting
      against SQL injection that, by changing how SQL queries are
      constructed, make validation and sanitization <em>part of the
        query process</em>. Thanks to prepared statements, manual
      validation and sanitization are not necessary.</p>
    <p>Prepared statements work by telling the database what a query
      will look like, using placeholders for inputs that are then bound
      to the query later. SQL injection works when the database can't
      differentiate between intended operations in the query and
      malicious input. Because prepared statements send the query and
      inputs to the database separately, SQL injection becomes
      completely mitigated with this approach. Also, since the database
      knows the types of the various table items, it can validate and
      escape data automatically -- minimizing the chance some edge case
      is overlooked and leads to a security leak. Prepared statements
      can also improve the performance of queries that are run multiple
      times. We will use the mysqli PHP library to use prepared
      statements.</p>
    <p>We need to connect to our database before starting:</p>
    <pre><code>$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");</code></pre>
    <p>The first step is to create the statement. This is where we
      specify what our query will look like, with placeholders for the
      inputs. Looking at the example above, the only input is $ssn, so
      we can prepare the statement like this:</p>
    <pre><code>$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM personal WHERE ssn LIKE (?)"); </code></pre>
    <p>The second step is binding the input to the query. We need to
      specify the expected type for each input (as a single string),
      along with each of the inputs. Types are specified with "d" for
      decimal, "i" for integer, "s" for string, and "b" for boolean.
      Assuming ssn is is a string:</p>
    <pre><code>$stmt-&gt;bind_param("s", $ssn);</code></pre>
    <p>If we had an additional parameter, such as age, we bind the
      parameters like this:</p>
    <pre><code>$stmt-&gt;bind_param("si", $ssn, $age);</code></pre>
    <p>The third step is to execute the query:</p>
    <pre><code>$stmt-&gt;execute();</code></pre>
    <p>If we want to run the query multiple times with different input,
      we only need to re-run steps two and three.</p>
    <p>To read output from the statement, we use the <code>get_result()</code>
      method, which reads one result at a time.</p>
    <pre><code>$res = $stmt-&gt;get_result();</code></pre>
    <p>To get an associative array with the row names as keys:</p>
    <pre><code>$row = $res-&gt;fetch_assoc();</code></pre>
    <p>If we have multiple results, we can iterate over them like this:</p>
    <pre><code>$result = $stmt-&gt;get_result();
while($row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc())</code></pre>
    <p>Then we can read the result:</p>
    <pre><code>printf("Name: %s, DoB: %s\n", $row['name'], $row['dob']);</code></pre>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="other/idea.png"> <strong>Note</strong>: the existing
        code returns results as an <em>array</em>, while mysqli returns
        results as an <em>associative array</em> (sometimes called a <em>dictionary</em>
        or in Perl a <em>hash</em>).Arrays are indexed by integers, but
        associative arrays are indexed by keys, which can be arbitrary
        string values. So, with the old code you might do something like
        this:</p>
      <pre><code>$id = $row[0]; </code></pre>
      <p>... but in the new code you would do something like this:</p>
      <pre><code>$id = $row['id'];</code></pre>
      <p>You can also embed associative arrays in strings by surrounding
        them with curly braces:</p>
      <pre><code>echo "The ID is: {$row['id']}";</code></pre>

    <p>This section will describe some tools you may need to complete
      this exercise.</p>
    <h2 id="diff-and-patch-see-differences-and-create-source-patches">diff





      and patch: see differences and create source patches</h2>
    <p>In this exercise, you'll be fixing security vulnerabilities in a
      few simple programs. However, instead of your whole program, we
      only want the <em>differences</em> between your new, fixed,
      program, and the original. A file which contains only the <em>changes</em>
      between two revisions of a program is called a "patch."
      Fortunately, creating patch files for single-file source programs
      is easy.</p>
    <p>To see the differences between two files on Unix, you use the <code>diff</code>
      utility:</p>
    <pre><code>$ diff one.txt two.txt</code></pre>
    <p>Another useful tool is called <code>patch</code>. <code>patch</code>
      takes properly-formatted <code>diff</code> output, and applies
      the changes to the original file. <code>diff</code> can generate
      this output with a few options:</p>
    <pre><code>$ diff -u oldcode.c newcode.c &gt; fixed.patch</code></pre>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="lab-sqli_files/idea.png"> <code>diff</code> has many
        options to modify its behavior (see <code>man diff</code> for
        more information).</p>
    </div>
    <p>This above options for <code>diff</code> will create a patch
      with the filenames and all necessary information that the <code>patch</code>
      program requires. This makes patching as simple as executing:</p>
    <pre><code>$ patch oldcode.c -i fixed.patch -o new-patched-file.c</code></pre>
    <p>... and this will create a patched version of the program that
      you can test.</p>
    <p>When submitting a patch file, it is <strong>highly recommended</strong>
      that you create the patch and then <strong>test it</strong>
      before submitting it to make sure that it works. You will not get
      any points for code that does not execute or compile in the
      exercise environment.</p>
    <p>If you're having permissions problems, consider switching to root
      by executing <code>sudo su -</code> or change the permissions of
      the source directory in question.</p>
    <h2 id="mysql-command-line-mysql-client">mysql: command line mysql
      client</h2>
    <p>When attackers try to create SQL injection attacks, they often
      know very little about the the database schema. In our case, we
      have hands-on access to the database, so this should make the job
      of developing injection attacks easier. This is where the MySQL
      command-line client comes in.</p>
    <p>To use the MySQL command line on the server, run a command like
      this:</p>
    <pre><code>$ mysql -uroot -pzubaz99</code></pre>
    <p>... <code>root</code> is the user and <code>zubaz99</code> is
      the password -- and the lack of spaces is important.</p>
    <p>This is essentially an SQL "shell" and gives you root access to
      the entire database. Once you get logged in to the database, you
      need to select the database to use. Then, you can make selections
      from the database:</p>
    <pre><code>MariaDB&gt; use fccu; # selects fccu database
MariaDB&gt; select * from accounts; # print all accounts information</code></pre>
    <p>Something that you may notice out of the ordinary is that the
      command line will prompt you with MariaDB instead of MySQL. Newer
      versions of Debian/Ubuntu are resorting to MariaDB instead of
      MySQL, which is a fully backwards compatible, community-made
      version of MySQL. MariaDB is faster and safer than MySQL, which is
      why MySQL was overwritten by MariaDB in newer versions of
      Ubuntu/Debian.</p>
    <p>The name "MariaDB" in the command line will be the only change
      you will notice with this lab. All SQL commands will remain
      compatible, but this lab will continue to use <tt>mysql</tt> on
      the command line instead of <tt>mariadb</tt>.</p>
    <p>If you scroll up, or limit the query, you'll see that <code>mysql</code>
      very nicely adds a title to each column -- this is the column
      name. So you could create a query like this to display all account
      information for accounts with an id greater than 50:</p>
    <pre><code>MariaDB&gt; select * from accounts where id &gt; 50;</code></pre>
    <p>There are many online SQL tutorials -- including some on SQL
      Injection, so we won't cover more here.</p>
    <div class="infobox">
      <p><img src="other/idea.png"> When trying to develop an SQL
        injection attack, you must consider the queries hard-coded into
        the script -- they are your starting point. You need to find a
        way to bend the query to your will -- you can't just start over
        with a query you like better. A good idea is to copy the SQL
        query from the script (or create one like it) into the mysql
        command line client and play around with changing it in
        controlled ways until you can get the result you want.</p>
